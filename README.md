# REPLgame

This is a fork of a cool game created by #C5fortheWyn colleage Jasmine.

We're learning how to fork as part of our learning how to use GitHub.

I am adding this to the README.md file as part of the forking assignment.

From Jasmine: 

> This is a Game of Thrones trivia game!
> Every point is worth 5 points. 
> If you reach 25 points before the game is over, then you win! 
> If not, you can continue to play until the game is over.
